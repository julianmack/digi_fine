"""Exercise 1 â€“ Create a list of random integers (5-10 integers). Assign each number with a probability.
Then randomly generate 100 numbers from the list given the probability distribution you just
generated. Finally, plot a histogram to show the results (i.e. number of times each number from the
list is generated)""".
