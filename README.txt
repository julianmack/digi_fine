SPECIFICATION
Data science technical test
Overview:
We have devised the following simple test to get a better understanding of your:
1) Experience of a particular programming language.
2) Approach to a particular problem.
3) Style and preference of writing code.
You are allowed to use one of the two languages (R / Python) and feel free to answer the questions
in any IDE of your preference. The idea is we will spend some time going through the results in a
Case Study meeting.
