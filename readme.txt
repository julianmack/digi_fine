ex1 and ex2 are both called from command line

ex1 USAGE:
python3 ex1.py n
where n is an int in 5<=n<=10 (i.e. number of integers)

ex2 USAGE:
python3 ex2.py


SPECIFICATION
Data science technical test
Overview:
We have devised the following simple test to get a better understanding of your:
1) Experience of a particular programming language.
2) Approach to a particular problem.
3) Style and preference of writing code.
You are allowed to use one of the two languages (R / Python) and feel free to answer the questions
in any IDE of your preference. The idea is we will spend some time going through the results in a
Case Study meeting.


Exercise 1 – Create a list of random integers (5-10 integers). Assign each number with a probability.
Then randomly generate 100 numbers from the list given the probability distribution you just
generated. Finally, plot a histogram to show the results (i.e. number of times each number from the
list is generated).

Exercise 2 - Please extract and derive the following information from the Wikipedia page about
Python (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and output the following
items:
• The name of “designed by” person for the Python programming language according to the
Wikipedia page.
• Number of unique words in the ‘History’ session.
• (Optional) Number of languages influenced by Python according to the Wikipedia page.
